                <h3>Week 1-5</h3>
                <p>I began my internship on December 18th, 2023. In the the first five weeks
                I've been here, I have become acquainted with all the people and processes that happen here.
                EFI Connection is a wire harness shop that specializes in GM TP1, LT1, and LS-Series V8 engines.
                Other branches include EFI Conversion, BenchForce, and LS-Wiring. My job is to monitor the 
                socials of these businesses/sites and create content for them. I am also taking videos and photos
                for the EFI Connection products. Ultimately, during these weeks, I have been taking footage, scheduling posts, 
                and studying the parts we sell.</p>
                <p>After this first inital post, I will provide weekly updates to this blog page.</p>

                <h3>Week 6</h3>
                <p>During week six, I have been organizing blog posts to schedule on two of the company sites. 
                    These blog posts talk about current industry products and car information. We had a meeting about Outreach Projects
                    on Friday to figure out how we should increase our apperance amongst car enthusiaists.
                    I also brainstormed ideas for how to increase reach through our BenchForce and EFI Connection site. Futhermore, I am looking
                    into a content scheduler for all of our socials, so posting content and social analytics can be easier to access.

                <h3>Week 7</h3>
                <p>Week seven was filled with little projects here and there. I fixed some of the Bitmojis I was tasked with making and
                    finished out blog scheduling for Bench Force and LS Wiring. I got the confirmation from my supervisor to use Loomly as a content 
                    scheduler, so I set up an account for that. Customers had sent in photos of their products, so I used their photos and reviews
                    to make social media posts. So far, I completed one for Bench Force and one for EFI Connection, and scheduled them through Loomly 
                    to test out the platform. In addition, to add multiple links to one site, I created a Linktree with all of our websites and social media
                    accounts. This week ended with brainstorming ideas for a Valentine's Day post.
