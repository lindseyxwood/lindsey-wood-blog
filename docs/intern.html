                <h3>Week 1-5</h3>
                <p>I began my internship on December 18th, 2023. In the the first five weeks
                I've been here, I have become acquainted with all the people and processes that happen here.
                EFI Connection is a wire harness shop that specializes in GM TP1, LT1, and LS-Series V8 engines.
                Other branches include EFI Conversion, BenchForce, and LS-Wiring. My job is to monitor the 
                socials of these businesses/sites and create content for them. I am also taking videos and photos
                for the EFI Connection products. Ultimately, during these weeks, I have been taking footage, scheduling posts, 
                and studying the parts we sell.</p>
                <p>After this first inital post, I will provide weekly updates to this blog page.</p>

                <h3>Week 6</h3>
                <p>During week six, I have been organizing blog posts to schedule on two of the company sites. 
                    These blog posts talk about current industry products and car information. We had a meeting about Outreach Projects
                    on Friday to figure out how we should increase our apperance amongst car enthusiaists.
                    I also brainstormed ideas for how to increase reach through our BenchForce and EFI Connection site. Futhermore, I am looking
                    into a content scheduler for all of our socials, so posting content and social analytics can be easier to access.

                <h3>Week 7</h3>
                <p>Week seven was filled with little projects here and there. I fixed some of the Bitmojis I was tasked with making and
                    finished out blog scheduling for Bench Force and LS Wiring. I got the confirmation from my supervisor to use Loomly as a content 
                    scheduler, so I set up an account for that. Customers had sent in photos of their products, so I used their photos and reviews
                    to make social media posts. So far, I completed one for Bench Force and one for EFI Connection, and scheduled them through Loomly 
                    to test out the platform. In addition, to add multiple links to one site, I created a Linktree with all of our websites and social media
                    accounts. This week ended with brainstorming ideas for a Valentine's Day post.

                <h3>Week 8</h3>
                <p>This week I scheduled more review posts for the EFI Connection Instagram and Bench Force Facebook. I worked with one of my supervisors to
                officialize where connector photos were going to be stored. I captured some content of production for the EFI Connection Facebook and Instagram. This also 
                included capturing content for a Valentine's Day post. The videos will be worked on this weekend so they can be posted.</p>

                <h3>Week 9</h3>
                <p>Week nine I edited the Valentine's Day Posts for EFI Connection, Bench Force, and LS Wiring. I scheduled and posted them for Valentine's Day, and they received very good
                feedback. I met with one of my supervisors, Chris, to talk about how we are going to store photos and the type of size we are looking for. We also worked on 
                figuring out the settings for capturing macrophotography photos. I worked with the owner, Mike, to take some footage of CNC machining and wire harness production.
                Our hope is to produce a "How it's Made" type of video. Finally, I worked on setting up a campaign strategy so EFI Connection had a strategic framework for Social Media 
                Marketing.</p>

                <h3>Week 10</h3>
                <p>During week ten, a lot of content was shot. We are working on creating a video for one of our partners
                to look at and get a sense of what the work/shop is like. In addition, more content was shot of the CNC machine
                for a production video. I began editing the video this week, I am hoping to get it completed by next week. I also scheduled
                some posts and updated the Linktree on our socials. Chris came in and worked on our camera set up for macro photos
                as well.
