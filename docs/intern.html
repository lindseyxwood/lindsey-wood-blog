                <h3>Week 1-5</h3>
                <p>I began my internship on December 18th, 2023. In the the first five weeks
                I've been here, I have become acquainted with all the people and processes that happen here.
                EFI Connection is a wire harness shop that specializes in GM TP1, LT1, and LS-Series V8 engines.
                Other branches include EFI Conversion, BenchForce, and LS-Wiring. My job is to monitor the 
                socials of these businesses/sites and create content for them. I am also taking videos and photos
                for the EFI Connection products. Ultimately, during these weeks, I have been taking footage, scheduling posts, 
                and studying the parts we sell.</p>
                <p>After this first inital post, I will provide weekly updates to this blog page.</p>
