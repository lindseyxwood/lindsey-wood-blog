                <h3>Week 1-5</h3>
                <p>I began my internship on December 18th, 2023. In the the first five weeks I've
                    been here, I have become acquainted with all the people and processes that
                    happen here. EFI Connection is a wire harness shop that specializes in GM TP1,
                    LT1, and LS-Series V8 engines. Other branches include EFI Conversion,
                    BenchForce, and LS-Wiring. My job is to monitor the socials of these
                    businesses/sites and create content for them. I am also taking videos and photos
                    for the EFI Connection products. Ultimately, during these weeks, I have been
                    taking footage, scheduling posts, and studying the parts we sell.</p>
                <p>After this first inital post, I will provide weekly updates to this blog
                    page.</p>

                <h3>Week 6</h3>
                <p>During week six, I have been organizing blog posts to schedule on two of the
                    company sites. These blog posts talk about current industry products and car
                    information. We had a meeting about Outreach Projects on Friday to figure out
                    how we should increase our apperance amongst car enthusiaists. I also
                    brainstormed ideas for how to increase reach through our BenchForce and EFI
                    Connection site. Futhermore, I am looking into a content scheduler for all of
                    our socials, so posting content and social analytics can be easier to access.

                <h3>Week 7</h3>
                <p>Week seven was filled with little projects here and there. I fixed some of the
                    Bitmojis I was tasked with making and finished out blog scheduling for Bench
                    Force and LS Wiring. I got the confirmation from my supervisor to use Loomly as
                    a content scheduler, so I set up an account for that. Customers had sent in
                    photos of their products, so I used their photos and reviews to make social
                    media posts. So far, I completed one for Bench Force and one for EFI Connection,
                    and scheduled them through Loomly to test out the platform. In addition, to add
                    multiple links to one site, I created a Linktree with all of our websites and
                    social media accounts. This week ended with brainstorming ideas for a
                    Valentine's Day post. </p>

                <h3>Week 8</h3>
                <p>This week I scheduled more review posts for the EFI Connection Instagram and
                    Bench Force Facebook. I worked with one of my supervisors to officialize where
                    connector photos were going to be stored. I captured some content of production
                    for the EFI Connection Facebook and Instagram. This also included capturing
                    content for a Valentine's Day post. The videos will be worked on this weekend so
                    they can be posted.</p>
            </article>
            <article>
                <h3>Week 9</h3>
                <p>Week nine I edited the Valentine's Day Posts for EFI Connection, Bench Force, and
                    LS Wiring. I scheduled and posted them for Valentine's Day, and they received
                    very good feedback. I met with one of my supervisors, Chris, to talk about how
                    we are going to store photos and the type of size we are looking for. We also
                    worked on figuring out the settings for capturing macrophotography photos. I
                    worked with the owner, Mike, to take some footage of CNC machining and wire
                    harness production. Our hope is to produce a "How it's Made" type of video.
                    Finally, I worked on setting up a campaign strategy so EFI Connection had a
                    strategic framework for Social Media Marketing.</p>

                <h3>Week 10</h3>
                <p>During week ten, a lot of content was shot. We are working on creating a video
                    for one of our partners to look at and get a sense of what the work/shop is
                    like. In addition, more content was shot of the CNC machine for a production
                    video. I began editing the video this week, I am hoping to get it completed by
                    next week. I also scheduled some posts and updated the Linktree on our socials.
                    Chris came in and worked on our camera set up for macro photos as well.

                <h3>Week 11</h3>
                <p>This week, I was unable to put many hours in at EFI Connection. In preparation
                    for the Alternative Spring Break trip I leave for on Friday, I have had copious
                    amounts of work to do. During the few hours I was there though, I created and
                    scheduled posts for the week I am gone. This included an Employee Appreciation
                    Day post and a CNC Machine work video. I also worked on the "How it's Made"
                    video. Slow progress as I am a perfectionist, and I want the video to turn out
                    well.</p>

                <h3>Week 12</h3>
                <p>During Week 12, I took some footage and pictures of the shop. Some of the footage
                    is going into a video project for EFI and the pictures were used for social
                    content. We had a meeting on Monday to discuss storage within the NAS system. I
                    continued working on video editing and content scheduling.</p>
            </article>
            <article>
                <h3>Week 13</h3>
                <p>Week 13 I worked on making progress with the LT1 video. In addition, I practiced
                    taking pictures of wire pigtails for the EFI Connection shop on Ebay. Some time
                    was spent color correcting the images since it was looking different than the
                    actual product.</p>
            </article>
            <article>
                <h3>Week 14</h3>
                <p>I made more progress on the LT1 video this week. Unfortunately, I was unable to
                    put in many hours as circumstances came up.</p>
            </article>
            <article>
                <h3>Week 15</h3>
                <p>After a discussion with my supervisor, he made some suggestions on what I should
                    fix up in the video. He also metioned that he would like an intro and outro for
                    the video. I worked on making those fixes and creating a draft of an intro.</p>
            </article>
            <article>
                <h3>Week 16</h3>
                <p>I was not able to work this week as we were in Daytona Beach, Florida for NCA
                    Nationals.</p>
            </article>
            <article>
                <h3>Week 17 and 18 + Final Review</h3>
                <p>Since the semester is coming to a close, I informed my supervisor that my course
                    work would need my attention throughout these weeks. Because of this, I could
                    not put in hours for week 17 and 18. However, I will be continuing my internship
                    over the summer.</p>
                <p>During my internship at EFI Connection LLC, I managed social media accounts,
                    captured shop activities through photography and videography, and produced and
                    edited videos. I curated engaging content for our online presence, showcasing
                    the shop's craftsmanship and expertise. My role contributed to enhancing brand
                    visibility and fostering connections with our audience.</p>
                <p>The concepts and skills acquired through DIGIT coursework greatly intersected
                    with my internship responsibilities:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Website Development: Creating websites for DIGIT projects honed my skills in
                        web design and development, which indirectly influenced my approach to
                        social media management. Understanding user experience (UX) principles
                        helped optimize content presentation on various platforms, maximizing viewer
                        engagement and interaction.</li>
                    <li>Data Visualization: The proficiency gained in crafting data visualizations
                        proved supplemental in analyzing social media performance metrics. Utilizing
                        Excel for data visualization allowed me to identify patterns, trends, and
                        areas for improvement, informing strategic decisions for content creation
                        and distribution.</li>
                    <li>Filming and Editing: Proficiency of Adobe Premiere Pro and Lightroom,
                        obtained in DIGIT coursework, empowered me to produce captivating video
                        content for our target audiences.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Key Learnings:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Adaptability and Versatility: Embracing diverse responsibilities fostered
                        adaptability and versatility in navigating dynamic work environments.
                        Whether crafting social media posts, conducting video shoots, or analyzing
                        data, the ability to pivot between tasks was important to meeting project
                        objectives.</li>
                    <li>Continuous Learning: The internship served as a catalyst for continuous
                        learning and professional growth. Each challenge presented an opportunity to
                        expand skill sets, refine techniques, and explore innovative solutions.</li>
                    <li>Industry Knowledge: Gaining insight in engine wire harness production
                        widened my knowledge about the industry and its' customers. Defining target
                        audiences and obtaining relationships with customers was essential in
                        propelling company initiatives.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>In conclusion, the internship experience has been immensely rewarding as I got to
                    apply theoretical knowledge to a real-world industry in the realm of digital
                    media management. As I continue on in this role, I carry forward insights,
                    skills, and memories that will undoubtedly shape my future endeavors in the
                    digital landscape.</p>
                <p>Thank you to the internship team, mentors, and colleagues for their guidance,
                    support, and collaboration throughout this enriching journey.</p>
