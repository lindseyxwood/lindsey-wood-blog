                    <strong>Protecting Our Beaches</strong>
                </h2>
                <img src="images/shadesBeach.jpeg" />
                <p>“The puzzling aspect of such situations is that the existence of obligations over
                    and above self-interest is taken for granted in such rural community enterprises
                    as the betterment of roads, schools, churches, and baseball teams. Their
                    existence is not taken for granted, nor yet seriously discussed, in bettering
                    the behavior of the water that falls on the land, or in the preserving of the
                    beauty or diversity of the farm landscape. Land use ethics are still governed
                    wholly by economic self-interest, just as social ethics were a century
                    ago.”-Aldo Leopold’s “The Land Ethic”</p>
                <p>Shades Beach Park in Harborcreek, Pennslyvania, is an example of how community
                    spaces can evoke environmental concern and social responsibility. This park has
                    been a space for the Harborcreek community to go, relax, play, swim, or hike. I
                    have been consistently returning to this park ever since I was a teenager, and
                    it refreshing to see the growth and investment the community has put into this
                    beautiful place. The following is a photo collection that features the typical
                    pathway through the park. Each photo reflects on Aldo Leopold’s insights about
                    obligations beyond self-interest when considering the environment.</p>
                <h3>07/29/2017 – Shades Beach with Friends</h3>
                <div class="image-row">
                    <img src="images/friendsBeach.JPG" />
                    <img src="images/friendsTree.JPG" />
                </div>
                <p>The two images above are of my friends and I at Shades Beach. We were thirteen at
                    the time and loved coming here to appreciate the beach’s’ beauty. The wooden
                    bench was removed and is no longer there; however, it was much enjoyed by the
                    community. Over the years I have spent a lot of time here and have reflected on
                    the many memories I have made, as well as many others. The community feels a
                    social responsibility to protect this beach and preserve it for future
                    generations. </p>
                <h3>Entrance to the Beach/Boat Launch </h3>
                <img src="images/shadesPath.JPG" />
                <p>The pathway begins at the short distance to the boat launch and beach area. This
                    picture encapsulates the direction one would follow to reach the beach.
                    Following the s-curve along in this image, one can see that along the rocks,
                    there is a boat launch. The Harborcreek community uses Shades Beach to gather
                    for boat outings, launch kayaks, or walk around the dock. The community is
                    constantly engaged at this park to enjoy shared activities or the lake itself. </p>
                <h3>Wooden Post with Litter Baskets</h3>
                <div class="image-center">
                    <img src="images/shadesSign.JPG" />
                </div>
                <p>As we approach the beach, newer items have been added like this wooden post.
                    Hooked onto the post is litter baskets for litter collection. In recent years,
                    the community has felt a sense to protect valuable assets of Harborcreek. This
                    post encourages visitors to maintain this park and volunteer to pick up trash
                    that others may have left behind. Preserving Shades Beach is important to keep
                    the park lively and beautiful.</p>
                <h3>“I Love HC” Monument </h3>
                <img src="images/shadesHC.jpeg" />
                <p>Next to the wooden post is the sign “I Love HC.” This monument is a testament to
                    the community pride and identity felt by the Harborcreek community. Each visitor
                    that comes into the park recognizes the importance of the environment and the
                    need to sustain it. By observing this monument and its meaning, one may consider
                    a commitment to protecting the beauty of the landscape.</p>
                <h3>Rocks for Erosion Prevention</h3>
                <img src="images/shadesRocks.jpeg" />
                <p>The rock barrier provides protection to Shade Beach Park as Lake Erie erodes the
                    beaches away. Pictured is my boyfriend picking up litter that made of made its
                    way onto the rocks. Both portions of the photo present a proactive stewardship
                    of the park’s shoreline. Environmentally, these rocks are needed to prevent
                    erosion and protect the beach for future generations. Protecting the park’s
                    biodiversity by picking up litter is important for maintaining the beach. </p>
                <h3>Cliff Area with Stacked Cement Slabs</h3>
                <img src="images/shadesCliff.jpg" />
                <p>If one’s eyes appear to the left side of the beach, standing tall is a cliff
                    formed from Lake Erie. At the bottom are stacked cement slabs which used to be a
                    part of the boat launch. Gazing at the beauty of the cliff while recognizing the
                    man-made cement provokes certain ideas about the beach and its importance. It is
                    a place of beauty, but it requires upkeep to continue to be a source of joy for
                    the Harborcreek community.</p>
                <h3>Bunny within the Greenery and Cement</h3>
                <img src="images/shadesBunny.jpg" />
                <p>Nature can morph with human-made technology over time. The greenery has overtaken
                    the cement, but one can still recognize its effect on the environment. The bunny
                    has managed to make use of this structure. Reflecting on Leopold’s quote, this
                    is an incidental harmony that humans have shaped without thought to their
                    broader ecological obligations.</p>
                <h3>Beach Timelapse</h3>

                <p>Shades Beach Park serves as a testament to the potential for community spaces to
                    inspire both personal reflection and environmental stewardship. While much of
                    its preservation is motivated by the community’s love and pride for this shared
                    space, there remains a lingering need for deeper, more consistent commitment to
                    ecological ethics, as Leopold describes. True environmental care requires moving
                    beyond self-interest and convenience, fostering an ethic that values the land
                    for more than its utility. As the Harborcreek community continues to protect and
                    invest in Shades Beach, there is an opportunity to embrace a broader, more
                    intentional responsibility toward the environment—ensuring that this beloved
                    park remains a sanctuary not only for people but also for the diverse natural
                    beauty it encompasses.</p>
