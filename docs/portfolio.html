                <p>“The puzzling aspect of such situations is that the existence of obligations over
                    and above self-interest is taken for granted in such rural community enterprises
                    as the betterment of roads, schools, churches, and baseball teams. Their
                    existence is not taken for granted, nor yet seriously discussed, in bettering
                    the behavior of the water that falls on the land, or in the preserving of the
                    beauty or diversity of the farm landscape. Land use ethics are still governed
                    wholly by economic self-interest, just as social ethics were a century
                    ago.”-Aldo Leopold’s “The Land Ethic”</p>
                <p>Shades Beach Park in Harborcreek, Pennslyvania, is an example of how community
                    spaces can evoke environmental concern and social responsibility. This park has
                    been a space for the Harborcreek community to go, relax, play, swim, or hike. I
                    have been consistently returning to this park ever since I was a teenager, and
                    it refreshing to see the growth and investment the community has put into this
                    beautiful place. The following is a photo collection that features the typical
                    pathway through the park. Each photo reflects on Aldo Leopold’s insights about
                    obligations beyond self-interest when considering the environment.</p>
