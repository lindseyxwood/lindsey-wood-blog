                    <strong>Protecting Our Beaches</strong>
                </h2>
                <img src="images/shadesBeach.jpeg"/>
                <p style="text-align: center;">“The puzzling aspect of such situations is that the existence of obligations over
                    and above self-interest is taken for granted in such rural community enterprises
                    as the betterment of roads, schools, churches, and baseball teams. Their
                    existence is not taken for granted, nor yet seriously discussed, in bettering
                    the behavior of the water that falls on the land, or in the preserving of the
                    beauty or diversity of the farm landscape. Land use ethics are still governed
                    wholly by economic self-interest, just as social ethics were a century
                    ago.”-Aldo Leopold’s “The Land Ethic”</p>
                <p style="text-align: center;">Shades Beach Park in Harborcreek, Pennslyvania, is an example of how community
                    spaces can evoke environmental concern and social responsibility. This park has
                    been a space for the Harborcreek community to go, relax, play, swim, or hike. I
                    have been consistently returning to this park ever since I was a teenager, and
                    it refreshing to see the growth and investment the community has put into this
                    beautiful place. The following is a photo collection that features the typical
                    pathway through the park. Each photo reflects on Aldo Leopold’s insights about
                    obligations beyond self-interest when considering the environment.</p>

                </div>
                <p>The two images above are old images of my friends and I at Shades Beach. The
                    wooden bench was removed and is no longer there; however, it was much enjoyed by
                    the community. This highlights how meaningful the park is to the community and
                    the need for it to be preserved for generations.</p>

                <h3>Entrance to the Beach/Boat Launch </h3>
                <p style="text-align: center;">The pathway begins at the short distance to the boat launch and beach area. This
                    picture encapsulates the direction one would follow and the appearance of the
                    rocks and boat launch ahead. This image symbolizes community engagement as local
                    residents gather here to enjoy the lake and shared activities.</p>
                <h3>PHOTO TO BE ADDED Wooden Post with Litter Baskets</h3>
                <p style="text-align: center;">This photograph depicts a wooden post with a message about taking a basket for
                    litter collection. This signifies the need to maintain the park and environment,
                    and it encourages visitors to participate in these actions. </p>

                <h3>“I Love HC” Monument </h3>
                <p style="text-align: center;">The “I Love HC” monument highlights community pride and identity. This extends
                    into the need of more ethical awareness about the environment that sustains it.
                    With this monument being in Shades Beach Park, one may consider a commitment to
                    protecting the beauty of the landscape.</p>

                <h3>Rocks for Erosion Prevention</h3>
                <p style="text-align: center;">This picture features the rock barrier landscape, and my boyfriend picking up
                    litter located on these rocks. Both portions of the photo present a proactive
                    stewardship of the park’s shoreline. Environmentally, these rocks are needed to
                    prevent erosion and protect the beach for future generations. In addition,
                    picking up litter off the beach highlights the need to protect the park’s
                    biodiversity.</p>
