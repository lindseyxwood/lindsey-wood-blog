                <h3>Reflection Essay</h3>
                <p>The most signifant challenges for a new learner within GitHub and HTML/CSS is 
                how to set up the documents, find the right CSS code, and remembering the commands to push.
                The process is more trial and error and requires time and effort.</p>
                <p>For the HTML method, one advantage is being able to customize the different aspects of the page.
                When using a software like WordPress, they pretty much set the standard on how you are going
                to set up your page. Within the realm of HTML, you control where the parts of a page are and the style
                they are representing.</p>
                <p>Modifying the site layout is one task that requires some time. In my case, we had to trouble shoot the locations
                for my pictures and figure out how I was going to frame them. You also have to be careful when using using flex containers
                and image properties as one may affect the other.</p>
                <p>You definitely need some coding basics to develop a site with HTML. However, it is also an easy concept to teach
                yourself if you have the time for it.</p>
                <p>To improve this site, some skills I would like to learn better is how to format the body elements better. I found
                that it was tough to manipulate the location of certain elements.</p>

                <h3>Corpus Analysis</h3>
                <p>The two texts I chose to compare were Biden and Trumpâ€™s inaugural speeches. 
                    Using Voyant, I discovered certain terms that each president used very often.</p>
