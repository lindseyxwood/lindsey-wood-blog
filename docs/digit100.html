                <h3>Reflection Essay</h3>
                <p>The most signifant challenges for a new learner within GitHub and HTML/CSS is how
                    to set up the documents, find the right CSS code, and remembering the commands
                    to push. The process is more trial and error and requires time and effort.</p>
                <p>For the HTML method, one advantage is being able to customize the different
                    aspects of the page. When using a software like WordPress, they pretty much set
                    the standard on how you are going to set up your page. Within the realm of HTML,
                    you control where the parts of a page are and the style they are
                    representing.</p>
                <p>Modifying the site layout is one task that requires some time. In my case, we had
                    to trouble shoot the locations for my pictures and figure out how I was going to
                    frame them. You also have to be careful when using using flex containers and
                    image properties as one may affect the other.</p>
                <p>You definitely need some coding basics to develop a site with HTML. However, it
                    is also an easy concept to teach yourself if you have the time for it.</p>
                <p>To improve this site, some skills I would like to learn better is how to format
                    the body elements better. I found that it was tough to manipulate the location
                    of certain elements.</p>

                <h3>Corpus Analysis</h3>
                <p>The three texts I chose to compare were Biden, Trump, and Obama's inaugural
                    speeches. Using Voyant, I discovered certain terms that each president used very
                    often.</p>

                </figure>
                <p>In all three speeches, each president used words focused on America and the
                    people. There is very little difference in their word clouds, however, there are
                    some words like “democracy” that are highlighted quite often in Biden’s speech
                    and “nation” in Obama’s speech.</p>

                </figure>
                <p>I find it interesting that Biden’s speech has a total of 2,397 words with an
                    average of 11.5 words per sentence and Trump’s has 1,281 and an average of 16.2.
                    Obama’s speech has 2,413 words and 21.4 average words per sentence. Trump’s
                    speech might be more concise than Biden’s and Obama’s, but the sentences have
                    varying structures. Obama has the biggest average and the most words. The most
                    frequent words used in Trump’s speech is America, people, American, new, and
                    nation. In Biden’s speech is America, nation, story, people, and democracy. In
                    Obama’s speech is nation, new, America, people, and—oddly enough—let.</p>

                <p>It is interesting to see the distribution of “my whole soul is” when using an
                    N-gram of 4. Biden uses this phrase often and every time he follows with “in”
                    meaning there more context to the phrase usage. When looking at 3 N-grams, he
                    often uses the phrase “here we stand.” When looking in the text, he used this
                    phrase very close to each other, possibly trying to get a point across.</p>

                </figure>
                <p>Within Trump’s speech, with a 3 N-gram search phrases came up like, “we will
                    bring” and “bring back our.” These phrases were commonly used together. In a 4
                    N-gram search, “we will make America” was used four times throughout the speech.
                    This phrase was used in the same sentence.</p>

                </figure>
                <p>Looking at the Obama speech, there wasn’t many sayings with a very high
                    frequency. The frequency ranges were from 1-4 for an N-gram of 3 and 1-2 for an
                    N-gram of four. Some of Obama’s phrases were “a new era of” and “men and women.”
                    Obama also spread out his use of these phrases in his speech.</p>
                <h2>Conclusion:</h2>
                <p>After viewing both N-grams and KWICs of Trump, Biden, and Obama, it seems that
                    they both used repetitive phrases to get their points across. However, Trump’s
                    phrases seem to focus on America, but Obama and Biden’s phrases seem more
                    personal. It was interesting to see the contrast in how words are articulated
                    and how each of them used repetitive phrases to get their point across.</p>

                <h3>Game Analysis - Wolfenstein 3D</h3>
                <p>In this game, the doors and wall created that illusion that I was exploring a
                    world. The graphics are pretty simple, it was very pixelated but features
                    detailed items like paintings.</p>
                <figure>
                    <img src="images/W3Ddoor.png" alt="image of Wolfenstein 3D door" />
                </figure>
                <p>The settings were simple as the rooms were pretty much the same, just with
                    different features. You can explore until you get to the end of the map or the
                    door with the switch. If you went to the next level it would look different. </p>
                <p>You control a soldier in this game. In the middle of the screen there is an image
                    of the soldiers face and he looks side to side with an investigative look. When
                    he gets hurt, he has a wounded expression. With the NPC characters, you shoot
                    them. That is the goal.</p>
                <figure>
                    <img src="images/W3DNPC.png" alt="image of Wolfemstein NPC" />
                </figure>
                <p>As a game player, you are challenged by being met with Nazis and German Shepards.
                    This game doesn’t really have an investigative gameplay to it, but it does allow
                    you to level up as you surpass each room. </p>
                <p>As far as objects, players interact with food, health items, treasure, and doors.
                    Food is only for health and treasure is to collect more points.</p>
                <figure>
                    <img src="images/W3Dtreasure.png" alt="image of Wolfenstien 3D treasure" />

                </figure>
                <p>The music is upbeat and slower in some areas of it. I think this has to do with
                    the fact that you’re trying to beat the levels as fast as possible. The other
                    sounds in the game just have to do with gun shots and the grunts of the
                    characters that warn you if there is someone around or the character is hurt. </p>
                <p>The game comments on itself in a “meta” way in the beginning when selecting what
                    type of difficult you would like. For example, for the easier gameplay, it has,
                    “Can I play, Daddy?” The game is making fun of each difficulty levels. </p>
                <figure>
                    <img src="images/W3Dlevel.png" alt="image of Wolfenstien 3D difficulty levels"
                     />
                </figure>
                <p>There wasn’t much commentary on the realities at the time in this game, however,
                    the basis of the game is to shoot Nazis. This game might have been politically
                    motivated.</p>
                <figure>

                </figure>
                <p>This game is an old game. I don't believe it could necessarily develop in the
                    future. If we were developing it back in the day, however, things that could be
                    added include more weapon and enemy variety and improved graphics.</p>

                <h3>Reflection</h3>
                <p>"Wolfenstein 3D," a first-person shooter from 1992, greatly added to the FPS
                    genre. Set in World War II, its environment and attention to detail in
                    recreating Nazi strongholds added depth to the gameplay. While focusing on the
                    player's avatar, B.J. Blazkowicz, the game's enemies, Nazis, serve as powerful
                    enemies.</p>
                <p> Objects within the game world, such as weapons, food, and secret
                    treasures, showcase gameplay and reinforce themes of resistance and adventure.
                    Its maze-like level design encourages exploration and rewards players
                    with resources.</p>
                <p>However, "Wolfenstein 3D" is not without flaws. Its simple narrative and lack
                    of character development may leave some players wanting more depth.
                    Additionally, its portrayal of violence, especially Nazi initiatives, may
                    unsettle some players.</p>
                <p>As an art form, "Wolfenstein 3D" offers a unique perspective into the potential of
                    interactive FPS's to evoke emotion and provoke thought. Its influence
                    on gaming cannot be overshawdowed, making it a classic worth exploring for its
                    historical significance and innovative gameplay mechanics.</p>
