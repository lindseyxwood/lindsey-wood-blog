                <h3>Reflection Essay</h3>
                <p>The most signifant challenges for a new learner within GitHub and HTML/CSS is 
                how to set up the documents, find the right CSS code, and remembering the commands to push.
                The process is more trial and error and requires time and effort.</p>
                <p>For the HTML method, one advantage is being able to customize the different aspects of the page.
                When using a software like WordPress, they pretty much set the standard on how you are going
                to set up your page. Within the realm of HTML, you control where the parts of a page are and the style
                they are representing.</p>
                <p>Modifying the site layout is one task that requires some time. In my case, we had to trouble shoot the locations
                for my pictures and figure out how I was going to frame them. You also have to be careful when using using flex containers
                and image properties as one may affect the other.</p>
                <p>You definitely need some coding basics to develop a site with HTML. However, it is also an easy concept to teach
                yourself if you have the time for it.</p>
                <p>To improve this site, some skills I would like to learn better is how to format the body elements better. I found
                that it was tough to manipulate the location of certain elements.</p>

                <h3>Corpus Analysis</h3>
                <p>The three texts I chose to compare were Biden, Trump, and Obama's inaugural speeches. 
                    Using Voyant, I discovered certain terms that each president used very often.</p>

                <figure><img src="images/cloudObama.png" alt="image of Obama speech word cloud"/><figcaption>Word cloud of Obama's Inaugural Speech</figcaption></figure>
                <p>In all three speeches, each president used words focused on America and the people. There is very 
                    little difference in their word clouds, however, there are some words like “democracy” that 
                    are highlighted quite often in Biden’s speech and “nation” in Obama’s speech.</p>

                <figure><img src="images/countObama.png" alt="image of Obama speech word count"/><figcaption>Word count of Obama's Inaugural Speech and most common words</figcaption></figure>
                <p>I find it interesting that Biden’s speech has a total of 2,397 words with an average of 
                    11.5 words per sentence and Trump’s has 1,281 and an average of 16.2. Obama’s speech has 
                    2,413 words and 21.4 average words per sentence. Trump’s speech might be more concise than 
                    Biden’s and Obama’s, but the sentences have varying structures. Obama has the biggest average 
                    and the most words. The most frequent words used in Trump’s speech is America, people, 
                    American, new, and nation. In Biden’s speech is America, nation, story, people, and democracy. 
                    In Obama’s speech is nation, new, America, people, and—oddly enough—let.</p>

                <p>It is interesting to see the distribution of “my whole soul is” when using an 
                    N-gram of 4. Biden uses this phrase often and every time he follows with “in” 
                    meaning there more context to the phrase usage. When looking at 3 N-grams, he often 
                    uses the phrase “here we stand.” When looking in the text, he used this phrase very close 
                    to each other, possibly trying to get a point across.</p>

                <p>Within Trump’s speech, with a 3 N-gram search phrases came up like, “we will bring” and 
                    “bring back our.” These phrases were commonly used together. In a 4 N-gram search, “we will 
                    make America” was used four times throughout the speech. This phrase was used in the same 
                    sentence.</p>

                <p>Looking at the Obama speech, there wasn’t many sayings with a very high frequency. 
                    The frequency ranges were from 1-4 for an N-gram of 3 and 1-2 for an N-gram of four. 
                    Some of Obama’s phrases were “a new era of” and “men and women.” Obama also spread out his 
                    use of these phrases in his speech.</p>
                <h2>Conclusion:</h2>
                <p>After viewing both N-grams and KWICs of Trump, Biden, and Obama, it seems that they both 
                    used repetitive phrases to get their points across. However, Trump’s phrases seem to 
                    focus on America, but Obama and Biden’s phrases seem more personal. It was interesting 
                    to see the contrast in how words are articulated and how each of them used repetitive 
                    phrases to get their point across.</p>
